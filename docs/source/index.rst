Atomic Similation Interface (ASI) API
=====================================

Atomic Simulation Interface (ASI) is a native C-style API that includes functions for export and import of data structures that are used in electronic structure calculations and for classical molecular dynamics simulations. ASI aims to be a uniform, generic and efficient interface for connecting various computational chemistry and materials science codes in multiscale simulation workflows, such as QM/MM, QM/ML, QM/QM. ASI specifies functions, data types and calling conventions for export and import of density matrices, overlap and Hamiltonian matrices, electrostatic potential, atomic coordinates, charges, total energy and forces.
